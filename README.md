Iam  receiving an error message like VT-x is disabled in the BIOS for all CPU modes (VERR_VMX_MSR_ALL_VMX_DISABLED).:

And also receiving an error message like Compressed image is corrupted 'C:\Users\myname\ubuntu_1404_vm_F18-disk001.vmdk' (VERR_ZIP_CORRUPTED):

During "Guest Additions" installation, Iam get an error message like: Could not mount the media/drive 'C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso' (VERR_PDM_MEDIA_LOCKED).:

And getting a "E_invalidarg" error when trying to import the virtual image.
